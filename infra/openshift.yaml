# Service: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/

# Route: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html
# In short: An OpenShift specific concept but equal to the Ingress resource in Kubernetes with some extra sugar on-top. The Route exposes your selected service to the outside world via a hostname (e.g. workshop-test-for-ae.com). If no hostname is defined in the spec it will use cluster defaults. We will do this as we don't have any custom domains right now.
